- 👋 Hi, I’m @hey-romy, I'm a Product Designer from Brazil.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my portfolio, using Notion + Github + Vercel.
- 💞️ I’m looking constructive feedback! I am not a developer, so my code might not always be perfect.
- 📫 Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn!
